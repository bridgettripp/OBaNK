Description: OBaNK (Omics Integration Using Bayesian Networks and External Knowledge) learns 
    the interaction structure of multiomics data through probabilistic graphical modeling and
    external knowledge. OBaNK takes as input a single matrix (csv) of omics data generated from a two-
    group experimental design and learns the interactions between the different omics.
